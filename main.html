		Time, Space, Complexity
	</h1>
	<p>		
Time complexity assesses an algorithm's efficient as it deals with varying input sizes, highlighting its adeptness in managing larger datasets.
	</p>
	<p>
		
	<b>Space complexity</b>refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute with respect to the input size. It is a measure of how efficiently memory is utilized during the execution of an algorithm. In Big O notation, space complexity is denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input.
