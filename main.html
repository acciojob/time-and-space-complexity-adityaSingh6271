  <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

  <p>Time complexity refers to the measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete in relation to the size of the input data. It evaluates how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. An algorithm is considered efficient if it can handle larger inputs without significantly increasing the time taken for execution, often denoted as optimal time complexity.</p>

  <p>Space complexity, denoted as <b>Space Complexity</b>, is the measure of the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute based on the input size. In Big O notation, space complexity is represented as O(n), where 'n' denotes the size of the input. This notation signifies that the space used by the algorithm increases linearly with the input size. It takes into account the memory used by the input, variables, data structures, and any auxiliary space needed for computations.</p>
